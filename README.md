# Final Fantasy X Monster Arena Checklist App
#### User Story
"I am a Final Fantasy X player, I want a way to remember which monsters I've captured so I can minimize on backtracking in the game"

#### User Scenario 
Brian sits on the couch to play FFX, he is at the point in the game where he is focused on caputuring monsters. It's hard to keep track of which monsters are where and how many he has captured. Brian opens up the app and finds the first location of monsters, then finds and captures the listed monsters there. All the while he is able to quickly check off which and the number of each monsters he has captured in the app. Brian repeats this action for 3 more locations and needs to end his play session. When he returns to the game some time later he is able to start caputuring right where he left off

## Design
With core functionallity nearing completion I have started on creating designs for the application. First I've looked in to how others have tried to handle this issue. 
Final Fantasy 10 it's self has this list built in its game play. However the in order to access this menu the player must be in a spicific location. Furthermore when in the menu the player does not have the ability to hunt monsters at the same time. Hents the need for this second screen experince.

XMonsters created by Zouhair Mahieddine, is an application thats core functionality is the same as this application. The user experince is stright to the point providing a list of locations with a click through to see the monsters in a very similar list. I'm not a fan of this design as while the list is stright to the point I think the spacing is a little small to hit for my fingers. I also think that location descovery could be improved if images were brought in from each of the locations

Watching online video tutorials, and seeing gamers play Final Fantasy in person on a controller showed me that because of how the game is designed players rarely took their hands off of the left side of the controller. The left side has the controls for movement, which when not in battle the player is almost always in motion to get to the next fight. This provides an avenue for the right hand to operate a second screen during which the can get knowledge of next monsters to catch and update information. Because of the limitations of spliting attention away from the main screen and only having one hand my hypothesis is that the user will  need items to be bigger and more colorful for them to quickly make choices of what to do next.
