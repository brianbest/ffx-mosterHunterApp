#### User Scenario 
Brian sits on the couch to play FFX, he is at the point in the game where he is focused on caputuring monsters. It's hard to keep track of which monsters are where and how many he has captured. Brian opens up the app and finds the first location of monsters, then finds and captures the listed monsters there. All the while he is able to quickly check off which and the number of each monsters he has captured in the app. Brian repeats this action for 3 more locations and needs to end his play session. When he returns to the game some time later he is able to start caputuring right where he left off
